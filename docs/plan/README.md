# PLAN Phase Instructions

## Your Task
You have 8-10 minutes to create a structured implementation plan based on the requirements you extracted in the EXPLORE phase.

## Deliverable
Create a **technical implementation plan** that demonstrates how you would build the Discount Engine Validator.

## Expected Components

Your plan should include:

### 1. Solution Architecture
- High-level approach to solving the problem
- Key components or modules you'll need
- Data flow from input to output

### 2. Implementation Steps
- Break down the solution into logical, sequential steps
- Each step should be concrete and actionable
- Consider dependencies between steps

### 3. Core Functions/Logic
- Identify the main functions or methods you'll need
- Define what each component will do
- Specify input/output for key operations

### 4. Data Structures
- How will you represent orders?
- How will you store and access coupon data?
- What intermediate data structures might you need?

### 5. Edge Cases & Validation
- What validation will you perform?
- How will you handle the edge cases you identified?
- Error handling strategy

### 6. Testing Approach
- How will you verify your solution works?
- What test cases are critical?

## Format
Your plan should be clear enough that another developer could follow it to implement the solution. Use whatever format helps you communicate most effectively:
- Numbered steps
- Bullet points
- Pseudocode
- Flowcharts (described textually)
- Function signatures

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
- **Completeness**: Does your plan address all requirements?
- **Clarity**: Is the plan easy to follow?
- **Technical Soundness**: Would this approach actually work?
- **Problem Decomposition**: How well did you break down the problem?
- **Edge Case Handling**: Did you plan for the tricky scenarios?

## Tips
- Focus on the approach, not perfect syntax
- A clear, simple plan is better than a complex, unclear one
- Make sure your plan aligns with the requirements you extracted
- Consider the order of operations carefully
- Don't forget about output formatting and reporting

## Time Management
Remember, you only have 8-10 minutes. Aim for a complete plan rather than a perfect one.

Good luck!
