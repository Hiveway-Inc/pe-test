# EXPLORE Phase Instructions

## Your Task
You have 8-10 minutes to review all documentation in this folder and extract the requirements for a Discount Engine Validator tool.

## What You'll Find Here
This folder contains various business communications including:
- Meeting transcripts
- Email exchanges
- Slack conversations
- Whiteboard notes
- Customer feedback
- JIRA tickets


These documents contain a mix of relevant requirements and typical business "noise" - contradictions, tangents, and evolving decisions that reflect real-world scenarios.

## Deliverable
Create a **one-page requirements document** that includes:

### 1. Core Requirements
- Clear, prioritized list of functional requirements
- Technical specifications
- Input/output formats

### 2. Assumptions Made
- List any assumptions you're making to resolve ambiguities
- Justify why you chose one interpretation over conflicting information

### 3. Open Questions
- Identify critical questions that need answers before implementation
- Note any requirements that remain unclear

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- Define specific, testable criteria for success
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions

## Tips
- Not all information is equally important
- Some details may contradict each other - use your judgment
- Focus on extracting actionable requirements
- Time management is crucial - you have limited time

## Format
Your requirements document should be clear, concise, and actionable. Someone should be able to implement the solution based solely on your extracted requirements.

Good luck!
