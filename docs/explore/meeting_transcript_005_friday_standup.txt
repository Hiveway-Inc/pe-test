MEETING TRANSCRIPT: Friday Morning Stand-up
Date: Friday, August 9, 2025, 9:15 AM
Attendees: Mike (Engineering), Alex (Junior Dev), Priya (QA), Sarah (Product), David (DevOps)

Mike: Quick stand-up everyone. Alex, how's the implementation going?

Alex: I've got the basic file reading working. CSV loads fine, JSON parses correctly. Working on the actual discount logic now.

Mike: Any blockers?

Alex: Well, I'm a bit confused about the expiration logic. Yesterday's meeting seemed to change the requirement?

Sarah: Right, yes. So expires_at should be inclusive. If it says August 15th at 23:59:59, the coupon works through the end of August 15th.

Alex: Okay, so less than or equal to comparison?

Mike: Exactly. 

Priya: That's different from what we tested yesterday.

Mike: I know. We'll need to update the test cases.

Sarah: Sorry about the confusion. Lisa was very insistent about customer expectations.

David: Are we still on track for today?

Mike: Should be. The core logic isn't that complex. Alex, how long do you need?

Alex: Maybe two more hours? The edge cases are taking time.

Priya: Speaking of edge cases, I found something interesting in the test data.

Sarah: What's that?

Priya: Order 1011 - it's a 60 cent order with the HALFPAST coupon. That would make it 30 cents after discount.

Mike: Right, that triggers the minimum charge threshold.

Priya: But what's the exact behavior? Do we make it free or reject the coupon?

Sarah: Robert wants to see data before deciding. For now, make it configurable.

Alex: Configurable how? Environment variable?

Mike: Let's just add a constant at the top of the file. ALLOW_FREE_UNDER_MINIMUM = True or False.

David: Which should be the default?

Sarah: True. Make it free. Better customer experience.

Priya: I'll test both paths.

Alex: Oh, another question. For the summary, what format? The spec says markdown but doesn't give details.

Sarah: Keep it simple. Headers for different sections, bullet points for stats, maybe a table for the breakdown by status.

Mike: Something like: Total orders, total discount amount, then a table showing counts for applied, rejected, invalid, expired, none.

Sarah: Perfect. And highlight any anomalies at the bottom.

David: What counts as an anomaly?

Mike: Invalid codes that were attempted, orders that hit the minimum charge threshold, maybe any calculation errors.

Alex: Calculation errors?

Mike: If somehow the math doesn't add up. Shouldn't happen, but good to check.

Priya: What about orders with zero or negative amounts?

Sarah: Flag those as anomalies for sure.

Alex: The test data doesn't have any of those, right?

Priya: No, but I'll add some for edge case testing.

Mike: Good idea. David, is the repo set up?

David: Yep. README template is there. Just need Alex to push the code.

Mike: What about dependencies?

Alex: Using only Python standard library. No pip install needed.

David: Excellent. Easier to run.

Sarah: Can we make sure the README has clear examples? Like the exact command to run?

Alex: Will do. Something like: python validate_coupons.py orders.csv coupons.json

Mike: Maybe with optional output paths too?

Alex: Oh, good idea. Default to results.csv and summary.md but allow overrides.

Priya: Are we validating the input files? What if the CSV is malformed?

Mike: Basic validation. If we can't parse it, error out with a clear message.

Sarah: But don't crash on a single bad row. Skip it and note it in the summary.

Alex: So resilient processing?

Mike: Yeah. Process what we can, flag what we can't.

Priya: What about the CSV headers? Are they required to match exactly?

Alex: Currently I'm using: order_id, customer_id, total_cents, created_at, coupon_code

Mike: That's right. Case-sensitive?

Alex: I was making it case-insensitive for the headers.

Sarah: Good call. More forgiving.

David: What about extra columns? 

Alex: Ignored. We only read what we need.

Priya: And missing columns?

Alex: That would be an error. We need all five columns.

Mike: Fair. Sarah, any other requirements we're missing?

Sarah: I don't think so. Just make sure the cents calculations are exact. Robert will check the math manually.

Alex: Using integers throughout. No floating point.

Mike: Perfect. How about we sync again at 2 PM to review the working version?

Priya: I'll have initial test results by then.

Sarah: Sounds good. Oh, one more thing - can we add timestamps to the summary?

Alex: Like when the report was generated?

Sarah: Exactly. For audit purposes.

Alex: Easy enough.

David: Should we version the tool?

Mike: Let's call it v0.1.0 for the prototype.

Sarah: Works for me.

Priya: What about error codes? Should the tool return different exit codes for different failures?

Mike: Good practice. 0 for success, 1 for input errors, 2 for processing errors?

Alex: I'll add that.

Sarah: Are we logging to stderr for errors?

Mike: Yes, errors to stderr, regular output to stdout.

David: Following Unix conventions. Nice.

Sarah: Great. Anything else?

Alex: Oh, the rounding approach. I'm using round() which does banker's rounding in Python 3.

Mike: Wait, really?

Alex: Actually, no. I just checked. Python 3 uses round-half-to-even, but for cents we want round-half-up.

Mike: Use decimal.Decimal with ROUND_HALF_UP.

Alex: Got it.

Priya: I'll test rounding edge cases specifically.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's wrap up and get back to work.

Mike: Thanks everyone. See you at 2 PM for the demo.
