MEETING TRANSCRIPT: Stakeholder Check-in
Date: Thursday, August 8, 2025, 3:00 PM
Attendees: Sarah (Product), Tom (Customer Success), Lisa (Marketing), CFO (Robert), Mike (Engineering)

Robert: Sarah, before we start, I need to understand the financial implications here. How much are we potentially giving away in discounts?

Sarah: Based on our projections, probably around 8-12% of revenue initially. Lisa, you have the campaign details?

Lisa: Yes! So we're launching with three campaigns. WELCOME10 is for new customers - 10% off their first order, no restrictions. It expires end of year, so plenty of runway.

Robert: No restrictions? What if someone buys something for a dollar?

Lisa: They get ten cents off. It's about acquisition, not profit on that first order.

Robert: [sighs] Fine. What else?

Lisa: 5OFF is five dollars off, but we're requiring a minimum ten dollar purchase. This one expires end of August.

Tom: That's pretty soon. Only a few weeks.

Lisa: It's meant to drive urgency. Then there's HALFPAST - our flash sale. 50% off everything.

Robert: Fifty percent?! 

Lisa: Only for 48 hours! It expires August 15th. It's a brand awareness play.

Robert: That seems aggressive.

Sarah: It's a test. We want to see the response. If it's too generous, we won't do it again.

Mike: Just to clarify, when you say "expires August 15th", you mean it stops working at midnight on the 15th?

Lisa: No! It should work through the end of August 15th.

Mike: That's not what the technical spec says.

Tom: This is exactly what I was worried about. Customers will expect it to work all day on the 15th.

Sarah: Mike, can we adjust?

Mike: We can, but I need a clear decision. Does expires_at "2025-08-15T00:00:00Z" mean it works through August 14th or August 15th?

Robert: What do other companies do?

Tom: I researched this. It's mixed. Amazon includes the end date, Uber Eats excludes it.

Lisa: We should include it. It's more customer-friendly.

Robert: But that's an extra day of discounts.

Sarah: It's a few hours difference. Let's include the end date for now.

Mike: So expires_at is the last valid moment, not the first invalid moment?

Sarah: Wait no, that's confusing me. Let me think...

Tom: How about this: if expires_at is "2025-08-15T23:59:59Z", it works through the end of August 15th.

Mike: That's inclusive. I can work with that.

Robert: Fine. What about this fifty cent minimum charge issue?

Sarah: Right. Jennifer mentioned Stripe won't process charges under fifty cents.

Robert: So what happens if a discount brings an order below that?

Tom: Customer support thinks we should just make it free. It's good customer experience.

Robert: We're giving away product for free?

Lisa: It would be rare. How many orders are under a dollar to begin with?

Mike: In the test data, I see one case where it might happen. 

Sarah: I think for amounts that small, the goodwill is worth more than the revenue.

Robert: I disagree. We should require a minimum order amount.

Tom: But they've already added items to cart. Blocking them at checkout is terrible UX.

Lisa: What if we show a message? "Add more items to use this coupon"?

Mike: That's a UI concern. This tool is for backend processing.

Sarah: Let's build it to handle both cases. We can decide the policy later.

Robert: I want to see data on how often this happens before we decide.

Tom: Fair. Mike, can the summary show how many orders hit this edge case?

Mike: Already planned. Any order with unusual handling gets flagged in the summary.

Lisa: Speaking of the summary, what metrics are we tracking?

Sarah: Total orders, total discounts given, breakdown by coupon code, success vs. rejection rates.

Robert: I want to see average discount percentage and impact on margin.

Mike: I can calculate average discount. Margin would require cost data we don't have in this system.

Robert: Then just discount as percentage of revenue.

Lisa: Can we see which coupons are most popular?

Mike: The summary will show usage count for each coupon code.

Tom: What about failed attempts? If people are typing codes wrong?

Mike: Those show up as 'invalid' status. We'll count them.

Lisa: Oh! Can we track if people are sharing codes they shouldn't?

Sarah: How would we know?

Lisa: I mean, if we see WELCOME10 used by returning customers...

Mike: This tool doesn't have customer history. It just validates individual orders.

Tom: That's a good point though. Should WELCOME10 be restricted to new customers?

Robert: Absolutely. That's the whole point.

Mike: We don't have that data in the current system.

Sarah: Let's add it to the roadmap for version 2.

Robert: What about fraud? People creating multiple accounts?

Tom: Again, needs customer data we don't have.

Mike: The current scope is just: does this coupon apply to this order based on amount, expiration, and basic rules.

Lisa: That's fine for MVP. When can marketing start using this?

Mike: Tomorrow for the prototype. Early next week for production?

Sarah: That works. Robert, any other concerns?

Robert: Just make sure the math is right. I don't want to explain calculation errors to the board.

Mike: We're using integer cents throughout. No floating point errors.

Robert: Good. And rounding?

Mike: Standard rounding to nearest cent.

Robert: Not banker's rounding?

Sarah: Jennifer brought that up. We decided standard is simpler.

Robert: Fine. But document that decision.

Tom: Speaking of documentation, what should customer support know?

Lisa: They won't see this tool directly, right?

Sarah: Correct. But they should understand the rules for when customers ask about coupon policies.

Tom: I'll write up a simple guide based on the final rules.

Lisa: Make sure to emphasize the one-coupon-per-order rule. That always confuses people.

Robert: No stacking is non-negotiable. Our margins can't handle it.

Mike: Already enforced. The system only accepts one code per order.

Sarah: Perfect. Anything else?

Lisa: Oh! What about coupon code formatting? All caps?

Mike: Case-insensitive. WELCOME10, welcome10, WeLcOmE10 all work.

Lisa: Good. I'll make sure marketing materials are consistent though.

Tom: And spaces? Sometimes people add spaces.

Mike: Stripped automatically. " WELCOME10 " becomes "WELCOME10".

Robert: What if they use dashes or underscores?

Mike: Those would make it invalid. Codes must match exactly after normalization.

Lisa: I'll make sure we don't use any special characters in future codes.

Sarah: Good. I think we're aligned. Mike, let us know if you hit any blockers.

Mike: Will do. Should have something working by tomorrow afternoon.

Robert: And this is all USD, correct? No currency confusion?

Everyone: Yes!

Robert: Good. Keep it simple. We'll deal with international later.

Tom: Famous last words.

Sarah: [laughs] One step at a time. Thanks everyone!
