Subject: Coupon System Requirements - Initial Thoughts
Date: Friday, August 2, 2025, 4:23 PM

Hey team,

Following up on our conversation earlier this week about the coupon system. I wanted to get some initial requirements down in writing before our Monday kickoff.

Jennifer - you mentioned something about Stripe's minimum charge being $0.50? Can you confirm? This might affect how we handle small orders with large discounts. I'm thinking if an order would go below that threshold after applying a coupon, we might need to either:
a) Block the coupon application
b) Make the order free
c) Require a minimum order amount

I'm leaning toward option B for customer experience, but would love your input from a finance perspective.

Mike - for the technical implementation, we need to support both percentage-based and fixed-amount discounts. Marketing wants to run different types of campaigns:
- WELCOME10: 10% off for new customers (no minimum)
- 5OFF: $5 off orders over $10
- Various flash sales with 50% off (Lisa is calling one "HALFPAST" for some reason)

The system should read orders from a CSV and coupon definitions from JSON, then output results to another CSV plus a human-readable summary. This is just for internal use initially, not customer-facing.

Lisa - can you confirm the coupon code format? I'm assuming alphanumeric, no spaces, case-insensitive?

Also, we need to nail down the expiration logic. If a coupon expires on Aug 15, does that mean:
- It works until 11:59:59 PM on Aug 14? (exclusive)
- It works until 11:59:59 PM on Aug 15? (inclusive)

This always confuses customers, so let's be really clear.

Other quick notes:
- No coupon stacking (one per order max)
- USD only for now
- Apply discounts to pre-tax totals
- Never allow negative totals
- Round to nearest cent (standard rounding, not banker's)

Let me know if I'm missing anything major. Would be great to have everyone aligned before Monday.

Have a good weekend!
Sarah
